of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.

In some countries, bananas used for cooking may be called &quot;plantains&quot;,
distinguishing them from dessert bananas. The fruit is variable in size, color,
and firmness, but is usually elongated and curved, with soft flesh rich in
starch covered with a rind, which may be green, yellow, red, purple, or brown
when ripe.</content><author><name>Z</name></author><summary type="html">A banana is an edible fruit – botanically a berry – produced by several kinds of large herbaceous flowering plants in the genus Musa.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Kiwifruit</title><link href="https://zlisch.github.io/2021/01/25/kiwifruit.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Kiwifruit" /><published>2021-01-25T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2021-01-25T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://zlisch.github.io/2021/01/25/kiwifruit</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://zlisch.github.io/2021/01/25/kiwifruit.html">Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the edible
berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.

The most common cultivar group of kiwifruit is oval, about the size of a large
hen's egg (5–8 cm (2.0–3.1 in) in length and 4.5–5.5 cm (1.8–2.2 in) in
diameter). It has a fibrous, dull greenish-brown skin and bright green or
golden flesh with rows of tiny, black, edible seeds. The fruit has a soft
texture, with a sweet and unique flavor.</content><author><name>Z</name></author><summary type="html">Kiwifruit (often abbreviated as kiwi), or Chinese gooseberry is the edible berry of several species of woody vines in the genus Actinidia.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Bpples</title><link href="https://zlisch.github.io/2021/01/24/bpples.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Bpples" /><published>2021-01-24T00:00:00+08:00</published><updated>2021-01-24T00:00:00+08:00</updated><id>https://zlisch.github.io/2021/01/24/bpples</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://zlisch.github.io/2021/01/24/bpples.html">An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.

Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown species in
the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor,
Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of
years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European
colonists.</content><author><name>Zlich</name></author><summary type="html">An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Welcome to Jekyll!</title><link href="https://zlisch.github.io/docs/jekyll/update/2021/01/20/welcome-to-jekyll.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Welcome to Jekyll!" /><published>2021-01-20T15:32:11+08:00</published><updated>2021-01-20T15:32:11+08:00</updated><id>https://zlisch.github.io/docs/jekyll/update/2021/01/20/welcome-to-jekyll</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://zlisch.github.io/docs/jekyll/update/2021/01/20/welcome-to-jekyll.html">You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts &quot;Hi, #{name}&quot;
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
