            <h2>Me as a gamer</h2>
            <p>Hi, my name is Zina, a current first-year computer science student at ANU. I am enthusiastic with digital game works and always feel thrilled of the immersive communication experience that this new genre of interaction has brought me into.

            <p>I play both pop genres and somewhat controversary “odd games”, both multi-player and single-player ones. I am also interested in the concept of “new media art” and how video games could relate to it.</p>

            <h2>An art approach to games, or a game approach to art?</h2>
            <p>I am personally interested in the answer to this question. Though in the academic world of art people might not easily agree that video games are even an acceptable object of study. This website will be held as a blog of my game reviews and reflections. I will share game that interests me and discuss why it is special on its own rights. And take every post as an attempt to find a satisfying answer to my question. I also hope this website will be interesting for people and someday I may expand its communication capacities.

            <h2>My expectations on game</h2>
            <p>I believe we can make really serious art from the form of digital game. But I don’t think we should merely copy and paste the existing process of artistic creation onto games either. Oil paintings are canons from ancient times. Cinematography and photography can sit somewhere in between the daily life and pure art world. Nowadays almost every individual who owns a personal laptop can download an .exe file from the internet, and no special skills or attentions are needed for interacting with games.
